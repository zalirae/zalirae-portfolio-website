# Zali Rae Portfolio Website Assignment

This is the first complete website created by Zali Rae, a bio/portfolio for her own photography work and list of skills. 

## Overview.

This website was created with simplicity in mind, attention drawing to the imagery of the portfolio and easy to take in information on the subject.

Colour wise it's been kept to a simple off white background, with black text and lines. Accents such as links, buttons and navigation have been coloured with an ultramarine blue for contrast.

Fonts are Georgia and Arial. Georgia for headings to give them some interesting shape, and Arial for the body and paragraph font for ease of read.


### Responsiveness.

I have used (practicing still) Flexbox in CSS, to create the responsivness of this website, all pages are within sections in the HTML which I have created with variable widths & heights to create a naturally responsive page. Allowing this website to be readable and easy to take in from any device.

### HTML Semantics.

I have tried using as many semantics in the HTML as possible to create simplicity within the html files. I still feel I have a lot more to expand on my knowledge in that realm. But it has been a great process that makes a lot of sense, and I will enjoy learning more about it.

### Challenges.

Challenges I have mainly come across have been my level of knowledge semantics wise, which was good in that it made me do a lot of my own research and create a broader understanding of what rules there are.

Same with CSS in not knowing what exact rules go together and work together, but that was also a really fun process of discovery and there is so much information and knowledge out there which is great!
